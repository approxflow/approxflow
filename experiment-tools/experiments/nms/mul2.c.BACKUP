// ERROR: Had to manually do this with CBMC WITHOUT --slice-formula, even though the others have, because it simplifies it before even generating the CNF and then there's nothing to model-count on (or at least there are no comments in the resulting CNF)
int mul2(int i) {
  int v = i * 2;
  return v;
}
